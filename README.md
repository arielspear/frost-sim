Frost Simulation

Go to http://rubyquiz.com/quiz117.html to get the outline for this month's challenge!

There is a nice video example of what we are going for. Of course, ours will look way more crude and simple in the terminal and well... we love that! 

Also there are code examples at the bottom. If you want to truly learn through the exercise deeply, I recommend staying away from those!  

Have fun and CODE IT UP!
